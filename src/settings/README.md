# Settings

## What to place in this directory?

Place custom settings in this directory.
These are usually files located in the `docroot/sites/default` directory.

Settings files are loaded in number order from `settings.php`.
Add new settings files using the following convention: {$weight}-{$name}.settings.inc.
  e.g. 01-core-settings.inc, 03-config.settings.inc, 90-local.settings.inc.

Other settings can be included in this directory such as customised `robots.txt` or `.htaccess` files,
but these will need to be symlinked accordingly:
  * Use the `file-mapping` key for files generated by drupal scaffold
  * Add a custom symlink to the `link-src-files` composer script.
